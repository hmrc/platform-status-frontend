    <h3>What is this actually doing?</h3>
    <p>
        You are looking at the <a href="https://github.com/hmrc/platform-status-frontend">platform-status-frontend</a> which runs in the public zone.
        It is running a few tests designed to exercise different bits of infrastructure.
        For some of the tests it calls through to the platform-status-backend (not yet implemented) which runs in the protected zone.
        Hopefully the tests are descriptive, but more info is available in github.
